# Roman-Urdu-JS-wrapper
The Roman Urdu JS Wrapper is a small educational library that lets you write JavaScript programs using Roman Urdu words instead of English keywords. The goal is not to replace JavaScript but to show that programming languages are not magic. They are just built on top of simple rules and predefined words that humans designed.
